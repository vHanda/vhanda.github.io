title: Nepomuk Technical Documentation
---

I have been working a lot to improve Nepomuk's technical documentation
on the [techbase][]. And it now finally reached the point where I think
it covers most of the major aspects of Nepomuk. If you're using Nepomuk
in your applications, you should read it.

It's a little hard for me to objectively state if I've explained stuff
properly considering that I have been so involved in the development. If
you feel some section is lacking or you're having trouble understanding
it, please contact me. I'll be happy to update it.

And with this, I can (somewhat) tick off one item from the [Nepomuk BOF
todo list][].
