        <p>It’s just 1am over here, and for some insane reason I’m really sleepy. But I was messaging a friend (SMS not email) and it got me thinking. I love <a href="http://www.t9.com">T9</a>. Yea, that’s right <a href="http://www.t9.com/us/learn/">T9 - predictive text</a>. It’s just amazing. I’m one of those people who doesn’t like the SMS lingo, and prefers to type full words and sentences instead of abbreviations and word fragments! (Yea - the whole short part of SMSs are wasted on me!)</p>
<p>Anyway it got me thinking, that even though T9 is great. It’s really old and I think with the kind of phones we have now-days(processing power) implementing a couple of advancements should take up too much of the processors speed. I think. Here are some improvements which might be useful to freaks like me -</p>
<ul>
	<li>**Custom Word Capitalization -** When I add a custom word to my dictionary, I can choose if I always want it to be Capitalized. This would be really useful as most of the time I'm adding names of people and places.</li>
	<li>**Letter 'I' Capitalization -** When the letter 'i' exists on it's own. It gets capitalized.</li>
	<li>**Spell Checker **- Sometimes I don't know the exact spelling of a word, and when I start to type it incorrectly, my phone makes a loud beep to indicate that no such word exists. Maybe it should do a spell check on what I was typing and suggest a word. This would be kinda hard to implement.</li>
	<li>**Google Wave Spell checker suggester - **A couple of months back, when I first saw the 'Google Wave' video what really impressed me was it's spell checker. It automatically identified the difference between 'been' and 'bean' based on it's usage. I think something like this could be done to make the T9 suggest words based on what you're typing instead of the it's conventional statistical technique.</li>
</ul>
I think the last two would be kinda tough to implement. Not to mention a waste of time. Still .. it's nice to fantasize once in a while. :-)
