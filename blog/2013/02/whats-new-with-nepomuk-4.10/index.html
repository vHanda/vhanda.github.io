        <p>I’ve blogged about some of the more prominent changes in this new
Nepomuk release. I thought it would be a good idea to document all the
changes, which Nepomuk has gone through thanks to Blue Systems!</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2013/02/01/nepomuk.png" alt="image"></p>
<h1 id="file-indexing">File Indexing</h1>
<p>As the release announcement has been saying, the file indexer has
undergone the maximum number of changes.</p>
<h2 id="new-double-queue-architecture">New Double Queue Architecture</h2>
<p>We’ve <a href="http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/01/nepomuk-indexing-architecture/">split the working</a> of the indexer into two parts - The first
basic indexing and second full file indexing. The basic indexing quickly
indexes the basic information about the file such as the filename and
mimetype. This allows us to always at least answer simple queries. The
other queue, which is only run when the user is idle, extracts the full
information about the file.</p>
<h2 id="new-file-indexer">New File Indexer</h2>
<p>We’ve had some problems with Strigi earlier. With 4.10, we have finally
decided to <a href="http://vhanda.in/blog/2012/11/nepomuk-without-strigi/">release our own solution</a>. Our solution is arguably
technologically inferior, but it’s more maintainable and, for now,
provides a better user experience.</p>
<h2 id="mimetype-filtering">Mimetype Filtering</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of moving to this new file indexing architecture
is that mimetypes are a very important part. All of the file indexing
plugins use mimetypes to identify which types of files they can index.
With this, we decided to allow the user to control the type of files
that are indexed.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/2013/02/01/nepomuk-mimetype.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>By default, source code is now no longer indexed. Common stuff like
Documents, Images, Audio and Videos are.</p>
<h1 id="kioslave-changes">KioSlave changes</h1>
<p>Till the 4.9 release, the kioslave code hadn’t changed much. With 4.9.1,
we managed to optimize some of the code. The 4.10 release however takes
this to an entirely different level.</p>
<h2 id="massive-optimizations">Massive Optimizations</h2>
<p>The ‘nepomuksearch’ tagging slave could initially show both non-file and
file data. This means that it would also occasionally show contacts,
albums and other details. Selecting any of those would result in another
search for resources related to that contact. For this release, we
decided to optimize for the most common use case of listing files.</p>
<p>The ‘nepomuksearch’ kioslave, and all other nepomuk kioslaves, now no
longer show any result which does not have a URL. This coupled with a
LOT of other optimizations, has now yielded a super fast kioslave which
can display thousands of results in under a second.</p>
<p>There is also some <a href="http://userbase">interesting userbase documentation</a> about custom
queries on the nepomuksearch kioslave.</p>
