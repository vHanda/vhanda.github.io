*This is a pretty short post. *

I've previously ranted that one of the things I didn't like about *"The Dolphin File Manager"* was it's inability to open a *Konsole* window. Today, I learned it can.

A simple Shift + F4 opens *konsole* in a new window, at the current location. Normal F4 loads a small terminal window inside Dolphin. Considering the amount of times this has been searched for and asked, I really wonder why it's not publicized. Oh well.
