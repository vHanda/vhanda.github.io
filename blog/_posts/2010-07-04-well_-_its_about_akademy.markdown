Everyone is out to lunch, and I'm sitting outside the conference rooms waiting for Aaron's talk to start. I've still got a slight hangover from last night's wicked party!

The day was pretty eventful, the party was freaking amazing. I didn't attend all the talks, though. Most of the time I was sitting outside conference room #2 discussing Nepomuk and Sharing of semantic data. It was fun.

My camera seems to be rather retarded. So I don't think I can post any pictures right now, but you could check out the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/akademy2010/">Flickr group</a>.
