I know, I’m crazy! But just in case you haven’t – conf.kde.in is the first Indian KDE Conference to be held in Bengalurufrom the 9th – 13th March.
We have a spectacular list of talksabout topics ranging from Localization to Packaging to hard core coding! Additionally we have a series of workshops planned to get you started with KDE, and, help, you discover the amazing KDE community.</description></item></channel></rss>
