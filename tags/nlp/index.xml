Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just amazing. The endless possibilities, right? Frankly, the collaborative editing tools were nice, but what really amazed me was the spell checker, and the char-by-char chatting mechanism. The amount of time I spend staring at the screen - &amp;quot;**** is typing&amp;quot;. Ugh! Maybe this feature will be added to gTalk soon? Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping Facebook developers will look into it, and improve their chatting mechanism or maybe they could just get their existing chatting mechanism to work flawlessly.</description></item></channel></rss>
