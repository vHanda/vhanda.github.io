I moved away from Wordpress. My blog looks a lot simpler now. I should probably state that I have shamelessly copied the CSS style from Ant Zucaro. I&amp;rsquo;ll get around to modifying it to suit my needs.
My last attempt to move from Wordpress, was a spectacular failure. That migration is the reason there are no blog posts between July and November 2010.</description></item></channel></rss>
