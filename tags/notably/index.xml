Plus, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on designing the UI for this release, which I think isn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea. Notably is still not quite mature, and I think right now features are more important than polish.
Last week, I showcased some tagging UIs. They aren&amp;rsquo;t yet ready to be deployed in KDE, as they need to be polished quite a bit.</description></item><item><title>Notably v0.3</title><link>http://vhanda.in/blog/2011/09/Notably-v0.3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 12:58:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2011/09/Notably-v0.3/</guid><description>I finally decided on a name - Nepomuk Notes is now known as notably.
Unlike last time, Notably now has its own project page on projects.kde.org.
This release adds a sidebar which lets you browse your notes, sorted in a reverse chronological order.
