Specially in Linux where it goes bat crazy at times and starts gobbling up your CPU. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why I really think HTML 5 Video tag is the way forward.
YouTube has had an HTML5 beta for quite some time. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t like viewing videos on the YouTube player. I like the feel of my favorite media player - VLC. The great thing about the Flash videos was that they used to be cached in /tmp/Fl*.</description></item></channel></rss>
