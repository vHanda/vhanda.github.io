I finally decided on a name - Nepomuk Notes is now known as notably.

![A new version!][]

Unlike last time, Notably now has its own [project page][] on
[projects.kde.org][].

This release adds a sidebar which lets you browse your notes, sorted in
a reverse chronological order.

Next Steps
==========

-   Make/Find someone to create a nice icon
-   Allow browsing by tags
-   Better KWin integration
