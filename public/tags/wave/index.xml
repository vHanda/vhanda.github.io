        <description>Have you checked out the Google wave video? Isn&amp;rsquo;t it just amazing. The endless possibilities, right? Frankly, the collaborative editing tools were nice, but what really amazed me was the spell checker, and the char-by-char chatting mechanism. The amount of time I spend staring at the screen - &amp;quot;**** is typing&amp;quot;. Ugh! Maybe this feature will be added to gTalk soon? Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping Facebook developers will look into it, and improve their chatting mechanism or maybe they could just get their existing chatting mechanism to work flawlessly.</description>

        <description>It&amp;rsquo;s just 1am over here, and for some insane reason I&amp;rsquo;m really sleepy. But I was messaging a friend (SMS not email) and it got me thinking. I love T9. Yea, that&amp;rsquo;s right T9 - predictive text. It&amp;rsquo;s just amazing. I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like the SMS lingo, and prefers to type full words and sentences instead of abbreviations and word fragments! (Yea - the whole short part of SMSs are wasted on me!</description>
