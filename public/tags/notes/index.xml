        <description>About 5 months back I started jotting down notes about stuff that was going on. Some of them were personal, and some technical. For the personal stuff I had a separate folder where I would chronologically arrange my notes. A separate file for each day. The technical ones would be saved in other random places in variably getting lost. Thinking of a unique file name and file url is hard!</description>
