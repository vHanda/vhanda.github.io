      <title>KDE and The Semantic Desktop</title>

        <description>During the KDE4 years the Semantic Desktop was one of the main pillars of KDE. Nepomuk was a massive, all encompassing, and integrated with many different part of KDE. However few people know what The Semantic Desktop was all about, and where KDE is heading.
History The Semantic Desktop as it was originally envisioned comprised of both the technology and the philosophy behind The Semantic Web.
The Semantic Web is built on top of RDF and Graphs.</description>

        <description>Update: This blog post is quite old and does not reflect the current state of Desktop Search in KDE. If you&amp;rsquo;re just looking to disable it, you can either run the $ balooctl disable command or go to System Settings -&amp;gt; Search -&amp;gt; File Search -&amp;gt; Disable.
KDE SC 4.13 is finally out. As you may have heard this marks the release of Baloo. The bear is now out in the wild!</description>

        <description>As you might have read, the 4.11 release of Nepomuk is a lot faster while doing writes and therefore indexing is going to much faster. However, read performance was nearly the same.
Architecture All application communicate to Nepomuk via the Storage Service which acts like a server. It is responsible for loading the ontologies, managing virtuoso and sending change notifications. The read communications happen over a local socket whereas the writes are sent over dbus.</description>

      <title>We need more Indexers</title>
      <link>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/05/We-need-more-Indexers/</link>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/05/We-need-more-Indexers/</guid>
      
        <description>With the 4.10 release of Nepomuk, we decided to move away from Strigi and write our own indexers. We support most of the commonly used formats. Also, the new code is faster and more importantly more maintainable and easier to contribute to. So far this decision has worked pretty well for us.
That being said - we still do not have enough indexers. Over the last week I managed to write simple ODF and Office2007 indexers, but we still need some more.</description>

      <title>The Nepomuk Migration</title>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/04/The-Nepomuk-Migration/</guid>
      
        <description>A couple of days ago I talked about how we have been clearing up some unwanted data in Nepomuk for the 4.11 release - mainly graphs. This change comes with a increased performance of over 100% in many cases, and makes the codebase simpler, and easier to maintain.
Unfortunately, it comes at a cost.
The graphs in the old database need to be merged to a small number. This operation is a very time consuming process cause merging graphs is equivalent to slowly removing your entire database and reinserting it.</description>

        <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve become the maintainer of Nepomuk we have put a strong emphasis on performance and stability. One of the core parts of Nepomuk are the high level operations that are exposed to the applications. These operations are typically used to insert and modify data into Nepomuk. Each of these operations is quite complex and involves a number of complicated queries.
For this 4.11 release we wanted to simplify that code and make it more efficient.</description>

      <title>Nepomuk - Simplifying the debugging process</title>
      <link>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/03/Nepomuk-Simplifying-the-debugging-process/</link>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/03/Nepomuk-Simplifying-the-debugging-process/</guid>
      
        <description>When something goes wrong in Nepomuk, its easy for us Nepomuk developers to track it down, but for other developers and users it can be quite hard. Even simple things like reporting which component is malfunctioning isn&amp;rsquo;t completely obvious.
Over the last month, we have simplified some of the external details and added tools which will help us debug your problems so that we can fix things more easily. These all will be shipped with nepomuk-core in 4.</description>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/02/Whats-new-with-Nepomuk-4.10/</guid>
      
        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about some of the more prominent changes in this new Nepomuk release. I thought it would be a good idea to document all the changes, which Nepomuk has gone through thanks to Blue Systems!
File Indexing As the release announcement has been saying, the file indexer has undergone the maximum number of changes.
New Double Queue Architecture We&amp;rsquo;ve split the working of the indexer into two parts - The first basic indexing and second full file indexing.</description>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/01/Nepomuk-Tags-Kioslave/</guid>
      
        <description>Nepomuk has long required a convenient way of managing tags. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously tried this with a simple Tag Managing Application, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t something that we wanted to ship. For the KDE Workspace 4.10 release, we are releasing a Nepomuk Tags kioslave.
Listing Tags The kioslave provides a very convenient way of listing all the tags. You can even rename and delete tags, just like you would for any other folder.</description>

      <title>Nepomuk Cleaner</title>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/01/Nepomuk-Cleaner/</guid>
      
        <description>Nepomuk has a unique problem of maintaining an RDF store. Unlike traditional SQL based stores, RDF offers a very loose schema, which is a HUGE advantage. Unfortunately all of the current RDF stores do not support any form of schema enforcement. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the client code to make sure that the data being pushed is valid.
This has resulted in a number of problems such as strings being stored where an integer should go.</description>

      <title>Nepomuk Indexing Architecture</title>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2013/01/Nepomuk-Indexing-Architecture/</guid>
      
        <description>Over the last 6 months, while working for Blue Systems, Nepomuk has undergone a number of changes. The most public and noticeable change has been the major refactoring of the file indexer. One large part of this has been the migration from Strigi. The other large part is the introduction of 2 phase indexing.
With 4.9 and earlier, the file indexing service used to just have one queue, whose speed could be controlled.</description>

      <title>Nepomuk without Strigi</title>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2012/11/Nepomuk-without-Strigi/</guid>
      
        <description>Strigi has always been a large part of Nepomuk. In fact a lot of users still do not understand the difference between the two. It&amp;rsquo;s quite common to see bug reports saying mentioning &amp;ldquo;Strigi/Nepomuk&amp;rdquo;. Lots of blog posts do the same.
Strigi consists of a number of different parts. In Nepomuk we just used to use libstreams and libstreamanalyzer. These were pure C++ libraries. The great thing about Strigi is that it is based on streams, instead of files.</description>

        <description>Last week 4.9.1 was tagged, and it should release any day now. A large part of my time was spent bug fixing and stabilizing some of the most user visible features. This blog post highlights some of the more user visible changes.
File Watcher Apart from minor fixes such as extra checks for buffer overflows, and kernel version checks, we have two major improvements:
Memory Leak The Nepomuk File monitoring service had a serious memory leak in 4.</description>

      <title>Nepomuk Widgets Repository</title>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2012/08/Nepomuk-Widgets-Repository/</guid>
      
        <description>With KDE 4.9, we introduced a new repository called nepomuk-core. This contained a combination of kdelibs/nepomuk and kde-runtime/nepomuk. It was created because of the API freeze present in kdelibs. Considering that most of the client libraries are thin wrappers over the runtime components, it made sense to combine them in one repository..
In order to be compatibile with kdelibs, the new library is installed with the Nepomuk2 namespace.
Now with KDE 4.</description>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2012/08/Nepomuk-Technical-Documentation/</guid>
      
        <description>I have been working a lot to improve Nepomuk&amp;rsquo;s technical documentation on the techbase. And it now finally reached the point where I think it covers most of the major aspects of Nepomuk. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Nepomuk in your applications, you should read it.
It&amp;rsquo;s a little hard for me to objectively state if I&amp;rsquo;ve explained stuff properly considering that I have been so involved in the development. If you feel some section is lacking or you&amp;rsquo;re having trouble understanding it, please contact me.</description>

      <title>Faster Nepomuk Queries</title>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2012/08/Faster-Nepomuk-Queries/</guid>
      
        <description>Nepomuk has a very decentralized architecture where the different components exist as different processes. They are all variants of the same executable - nepomukservicestub. This servicestub loads appropriate service plugin. The main reason for doing this was stability. If one of the components crashes, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take all the other components with it.
Unfortunately this architecture doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold very well when the different components need to communicate with one another.</description>

      <title>Nepomuk Without Files</title>

      <guid>http://vhanda.in/blog/2012/08/Nepomuk-Without-Files/</guid>
      
        <description>Most people assume that if they switch off file indexing in Nepomuk, then all the nepomuk file services will get disabled. This is however not the case. Nepomuk consists of two services which are used to deal with files -
 Nepomuk File Watcher Nepomuk File Indexer  The Nepomuk File Indexer is responsible for calling the strigi plugins to index the files, whereas the FileWatch service is a general service that monitors file move, creation and deletion events.</description>

        <description>A little while ago, before Akademy, I started implementing the Shared Hash Memory table, so as to improve Nepomuk&amp;rsquo;s architecture. Architectural designs really interest me. I decided to be smart about it, if I was going to refactor some of the main classes, there was a very high chance I would break something. The code is quite complex.
I needed a way to make sure I was on the right track.</description>

        <description>For the last month I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a hash table which is stored in shared memory and can thus easily be used across applications. This is ideal for simple caches of data that reside in multiple applications. My specific use case was the Nepomuk Resource class, which is a glorified cache of key value pairs and uses a hash table. A considerable amount of effort has gone into making sure that each application&amp;rsquo;s Resource classes are consistent with the other applications.</description>

        <description>The Nepomuk development process has been fairly closed to outsiders. This was never a conscious decision made by the Nepomuk Team, we just never took the effort to open up the development, and make it more appealing to new comers.
For most of the last 2 years, the development model has been Sebastian and I working on our own personal list of things, and occasionally sending private emails to each other or communicating via IRC.</description>

        <description>In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t been running trunk, or haven&amp;rsquo;t tried out the latest release candidates (you really should), you should know that dolphin has had a lot of major improvements since the last release. One of the features I really love is better Nepomuk integration. This enhanced user visibility lands up exposing bottlenecks, and performance problems. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happened with the nepomuk search kio slave.
Dolphin exposes this neat sidebar which allows users to list out the different kind of files - Documents, Images, Audio and Videos.</description>

        <description>For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, I&amp;rsquo;m currently at Tallinn, Estonia for Akademy 2012.
Here at Akademy, yesterday was an amazing day for Nepomuk. Early morning we had a Nepomuk BOF titled &amp;lsquo;Constructive Criticism - Prioritizing Nepomuk development&amp;rsquo;, and it was really good. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have named it such, cause that might have ended in people just coming and complaining, but surprisingly everyone was really nice and constructive.</description>

        <description>The Nepomuk team has been working really hard to fix the problems with virtuoso consuming too much memory and often just going bat crazy. And now finally we&amp;rsquo;ve figured it out.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the obvious solution, but we think it&amp;rsquo;s going to work out very well. From now on virtuoso won&amp;rsquo;t be shown in ksysguard.
Since we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see virtuoso using up our memory and CPU, it obviously won&amp;rsquo;t be doing it.</description>

        <description>Back in October 2010, I was trying to write automated tests for Nepomuk Backup. That turned out to be a huge disaster, but the test suite was still had some pretty good stuff in it.
Most of it was based on George Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s Telepathy Test Lib.
Over the last month, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally moved it to git, cleaned it up and started using it for real tests.
Why do we need a testing framework?</description>

        <description>I land up using wget a lot. I know there are better alternatives, but wget&amp;rsquo;s simplicity has won me over. Plus, with applications like firefox, I&amp;rsquo;m not always sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to continue the download. That&amp;rsquo;s important when I&amp;rsquo;m downloading big files, but for small files, it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
A couple of days back, Martin and I were chatting about storing the metadata of a downloaded file in Nepomuk.</description>

        <description>I meant to release a new version of Notably on Friday, but I got sidetracked with some stuff. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on designing the UI for this release, which I think isn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea. Notably is still not quite mature, and I think right now features are more important than polish.
Last week, I showcased some tagging UIs. They aren&amp;rsquo;t yet ready to be deployed in KDE, as they need to be polished quite a bit.</description>

        <description>There have been cases of virtuoso going a little crazy and consuming a lot of CPU cycles. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely frustrating. However, it&amp;rsquo;s ever more annoying when you have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s wrong.
Most of bug reports we get just say that virtuoso is consuming too much CPU, and that isn&amp;rsquo;t the least bit helpful. So, here is a short guide to figure out what query is causing virtuoso to go crazy.</description>

      <title>A better Tagging Widget</title>

        <description>A long long time ago, a very simple tagging widget was implemented. We always though - &amp;ldquo;Eh! This is temporary. We&amp;rsquo;ll come up with a better one later.&amp;rdquo; But that never happened.
There is a lot of code in Nepomuk. However most of it is backend stuff which does absolutely marvelous things behind the scenes - Auto duplicate merging, type checking with respect to the ontologies, caching and lots more. We, however, lack good UIs.</description>

        <description>Welcome to Nepomuk Tag Week! Well, not really, since it&amp;rsquo;s not an official thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve just been working a lot with tags lately, and this week I&amp;rsquo;m going to be spamming you with some tag related updates (One for every day of the week, minus Monday)
I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll start with something small - Tag Management.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been badly needing a UI to allow the users to modify, merge and delete their tags.</description>

      <title>Chat logs in Nepomuk</title>

        <description>Prototyping is fun. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to care about proper libraries. Your code can be absolutely horrible, cause &amp;ldquo;Hey! It&amp;rsquo;s just a prototype!&amp;rdquo;
Yesterday, I started the process of importing my entire gTalk chat history into Nepomuk. It turned out to be a lot simpler that I thought it would be.
Step 1: Get the chat logs GMail fortunately allows you to export your chat logs via SMTP. They don&amp;rsquo;t implement the traditional XMPP-0136 for fetching offline messages.</description>

        <description>I finally decided on a name - Nepomuk Notes is now known as notably.
Unlike last time, Notably now has its own project page on projects.kde.org.
This release adds a sidebar which lets you browse your notes, sorted in a reverse chronological order.
Next Steps  Make/Find someone to create a nice icon Allow browsing by tags Better KWin integration  </description>

        <description>Another week has gone by and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to release another version of my favorite note taking application. Like last time the code is still in my scratch repository.
New Features Tagging Support I&amp;rsquo;ve added tagging support. So, now you can tag all your notes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use the traditional tagging widget, and wanted something that was more usable. So I ended up with a simple text box where you can type your tags.</description>

        <description>About 5 months back I started jotting down notes about stuff that was going on. Some of them were personal, and some technical. For the personal stuff I had a separate folder where I would chronologically arrange my notes. A separate file for each day. The technical ones would be saved in other random places in variably getting lost. Thinking of a unique file name and file url is hard!</description>

        <description>This is something I showcased at my talk in conf.kde.in. I coded it in a couple of hours. It is a lot of fun to play around with! I can’t wait to index all my videos this way.

Impressive? :D
This was showcased at the beginning of the Nepomuk talk under the section “Nepomuk is not about searching, but here are some cool things that it can do!”</description>

        <description>I’m going to state the most utterly insane thing I can think of – “You have not heard about conf.kde.in!“. I know, I’m crazy! But just in case you haven’t – conf.kde.in is the first Indian KDE Conference to be held in Bengalurufrom the 9th – 13th March.
We have a spectacular list of talksabout topics ranging from Localization to Packaging to hard core coding! Additionally we have a series of workshops planned to get you started with KDE, and, help, you discover the amazing KDE community.</description>

      <title>Nepomuk Backup</title>
      <link>http://vhanda.in/blog/2010/11/Nepomuk-Backup/</link>

        <description>Roughly 2 weeks ago, just before the feature freeze, the Nepomuk backupsync service was pushed into the trunk.
A long time ago I posted a lot of features about the ‘planned’ Nepomuk Backup service. I did land up implementing most of those features, but ultimately disabled some of them for a more stable backup experience. I thought it would be better to have a stable backup tool, without all the frills, compared to unstable tool which may potentially mess up your data.</description>

        <description>﻿How time flies.. a month of the official coding period is already over, and I&amp;rsquo;m nowhere even close to saying that this part works perfectly. Most of my code is still in the requires exhaustive testing stages, but I can say that the core parts have been implemented.
In case you&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten, or didn&amp;rsquo;t read the title, I&amp;rsquo;m implementing Metadata Backup &amp;amp; Sync. Well I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be implementing sharing as well, but ignore that for now.</description>
