        <description>The Nepomuk team has been working really hard to fix the problems with virtuoso consuming too much memory and often just going bat crazy. And now finally we&amp;rsquo;ve figured it out.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the obvious solution, but we think it&amp;rsquo;s going to work out very well. From now on virtuoso won&amp;rsquo;t be shown in ksysguard.
Since we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see virtuoso using up our memory and CPU, it obviously won&amp;rsquo;t be doing it.</description>
