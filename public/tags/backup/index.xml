        <description>Roughly 2 weeks ago, just before the feature freeze, the Nepomuk backupsync service was pushed into the trunk.
A long time ago I posted a lot of features about the ‘planned’ Nepomuk Backup service. I did land up implementing most of those features, but ultimately disabled some of them for a more stable backup experience. I thought it would be better to have a stable backup tool, without all the frills, compared to unstable tool which may potentially mess up your data.</description>
