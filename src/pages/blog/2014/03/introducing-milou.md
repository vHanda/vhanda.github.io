As many of you may have [heard](https://dot.kde.org/2014/02/24/kdes-next-generation-semantic-search), with KDE SC 4.13, the searching infrastructure has been through a big overhaul. Along with these changes, we will also be releasing a dedicated search plasmoid called "Milou".

Milou can also be used as an alternative to KRunner, and does provide application launching. The main difference is that it concentrates more on searching.

### Previews

Milou also offers experimental support for previews for different results types. The most useful of which have been emails -

### Release Date

Milou will be independently released around the same time as KDE SC 4.13.

I would highly recommend testing out the new search infrastructure in the 4.13 betas and release candidates. Milou just happens to be a perfect way to do that. Bug your favorite distro for packages!
