I regularly use KDE (Kubuntu 9.10), and I prefer it over GNOME. But I still think it lacks many things -

**1. File Manager** - I know many die hard KDE users will swear by *Konqueror*, but I just don't like it. Dolphin is really nice, and I've really come to like it after a while, but compared to *Nautilus*, it lacks the following features -
<ul>
	<li>No Video Preview.</li>
	<li>No 'Open Terminal Here' action - I know you can open the terminal for a folder or just press F4 for an embedded terminal. I just prefer the external *Konsole* window.</li>
	<li>No Auto Preview. - Nautilus would automatically show video and picture files as thumbnails. With Dolphin I need to do it manually.</li>
	<li>Does not directly open executables - I have to open the terminal and then do a `./name`.</li>
	<li>Sound Preview.</li>
</ul>
**2. Kickoff Application Launcher -** I absolutely hate it! It's like the windows start menu. GNOME's overhead menu was a lot better. One of these days I think I'll write my own KDE Widget which resembles GNOME's menu.

**3. Widget Customization -** I kinda like the System Tray and the Time to be on the top instead of the bottom. Now I can do this by adding a Panel and adding those Widgets, but they look horrible. They tend to hog up loads of space and expand unnaturally.

**4. KPackagekit -** I feel it's clunky and requires loads of work. For starters - It doesn't show how heavy the updates are and it doesn't show the speed at which they are downloading. Again the gnome-update-manager is a lot better.

Hopefully these things will be added in the future.
