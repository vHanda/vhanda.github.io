I've been getting kinda sick of the sluggish speed Firefox is running at. (Firefox 3.0.13 -- Kubuntu 9.04) So I finally decided to try Chromium, being a major Firefox fan boy I was extremely reluctant to do so! I found this extremely simple guide at <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-chromium-google-chrome-in-ubuntu-using-deb-package.html" target="_blank">ubuntugeek</a>. It barely took me 10 minutes to install, and the first impression was something in the terms of - "I don't like this blue colour, why can't it adapt to my GTK/QT theme, just like Firefox does!". It turns out it can, but you just need to tell it to do so manually.

After the initially surge of hatred (Yes! I don't like change, and I was determined to conclude that it is a horrible piece of trash.) I, much to my disappointment, actually started to like it. Here are a couple of things that impressed me -
<ul>
	<li>**Speed - **The glorious glorious speed. WOW!!</li>
	<li>**Theme Changing -** When changing the theme, I didn't have to restart the chromium-browser. I always have to restart Firefox, and even though it reloads all my tabs. I still don't like having to do it!</li>
	<li>**Remember Password -** When you visit a site, enter your username/password, and click the 'login' button, Firefox instantly shows a small bar asking whether you want to save the password. Whereas chromium waits till the page has finished loading and then asks you! This seemed really logical and intuitive to me. I wonder why Firefox doesn't do it this way.</li>
	<li>**New Tab Page - **After seeing Chromium's new tab page all I can say is that - It seems kinda dumb to have a blank page when I open a new tab, specially since this is so much more convenient.</li>
	<li>**User Interface - **I'm not a fan of this minimalist design, but it's really starting to grow on me! And I've actually (to my regret) started to like it. Firefox's interface seems kinda cluttered in comparison.</li>
	<li>**Tab Handling - **I like the way the tabs open and close, and the fact that when I open a new tab it is placed right next to the tab which spawned it. Similarly when I close a tab, it automatically goes to the last accessed tab. This seems like a really intuitive thing to me I wonder why Firefox doesn't do it by default ( I know it has been done via Plugins ).</li>
</ul>
So far *Chromium *seems kinda amazing. I know it lacks loads of features, but HEY! it's a work in progress. And the developer documentation seems kinda interesting as well! Not that I've ever bothered to read Firefox's developer documentation, so I really shouldn't be comparing.

Firefox is an amazing browser and I don't think I'm in a position to leave it completely (There are too many extensions I use regularly), but *'Chromium'* (or Google Chrome, specifics don't really matter) is going to give it a major run for it's money! But then that doesn't really matter!! All that matters is that people should stop using *that crappy internet explorer*.

If only I could convince my parents to let go of it ..
